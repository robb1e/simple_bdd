# Simple BDD

Simple BDD offers basic Behaviour Driven Development language syntax. It enables tests to take steps to become more declaritive than imperiative by hiding the implementation and revealing test intent. It can be used in any test framework as it's just a way to keep the collaborative business language within a test by calling methods which directly relate to the step in the test.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'simple_bdd'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:
